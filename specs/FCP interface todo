timestamp for keepalive + message from message itself instead of using new Date().getTime()?

think about last activity + timeout for users that are announced but not joined a channel
how to convert irc colors and [b], [i], [u]?

why the fuck does flip wait for new identity message after inactive > x (30?)

escape \ in fcp commands and flic events (simpleFieldSets) replace("\\\\", "\\\\")
validate nicknames before accepting them
validate channels before accepting them

recheck fcp interface <=> actual messages
especially #chan != chan

automatic topic propagation

replace all the for x : y with iterators
